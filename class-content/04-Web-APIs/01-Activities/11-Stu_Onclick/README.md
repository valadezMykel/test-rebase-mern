# addEventListener On Click

In this activity, we are going to create a button that increments a counter when clicked.

## Instructions

- In a file called `index.html`, locate the button containing the string "Increment". Note it's id attribute.

- In a file called `script.js`, create an event listener with a callback that increments the counter and displays the updated count on the webpage.

- Add a button that decrements the counter when clicked.

## Bonus

- Add some code to ensure that the count never gets below 0.
